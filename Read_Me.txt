This is an updated version of datamanager. The key functionality that I am trying to get is being able to generate a RunInfoTable.csv automatically.

Inputs:
Ideally simply selecting the first day you want in a folder explorer window.
Then, selecting the final folder that you want to consider in another folder window.

Ouptputs:
See something like RunInfoTable.csv. That has to be there.
